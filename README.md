# CompleteCSharpMasterClass

This project is developed based on the course "Complete C# Masterclass". Hence, most of the code you see in this repository contains my personal notes and just trying out things to learn the language a bit better (this is how I roll).

For much better experience, I recommend buying the course yourself: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-csharp-masterclass

## Used software / environment

- Windows 7
- Microsoft Visual Studio Community 16
- Console App (.NET core) project(s)
- C# Version 7.3
